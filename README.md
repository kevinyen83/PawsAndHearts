## About The Project

![Alt text](https://github.com/kevinyen83/PawsAndHearts/blob/main/screenshots/adoption.png)

Paws and Hearts is an exciting new side project that combines my passion for animals with my skills in full-stack development. Having volunteered at a Sydney animal shelter, I understand the importance of creating a seamless and user-friendly experience for both potential adopters and shelter staff.

With Paws and Hearts, I aim to leverage the latest programming tools and JavaScript frameworks to revolutionize the animal adoption process. From streamlining application procedures to securely managing user data, this project is all about making the adoption journey as smooth and enjoyable as possible.

I'm committed to continuously optimizing the website and welcome any feedback or collaboration opportunities. Together, we can make a real difference in the lives of animals in need!
